# Electricity-Prediction
## Overview
The notebook provides an end-to-end workflow for predicting electricity consumption. The main steps include:

  - Data Loading: Reading the dataset containing electricity data.
  - Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data (e.g., handling missing values, formatting dates, and feature extraction) to make it suitable for modeling.
  - Model Definition: Constructing a regression model (which may use traditional machine learning techniques or a neural network) tailored for forecasting electricity consumption.
  - Training Process: Training the model on historical electricity data.
  - Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using numerical metrics such as error rates.
## Key Features
Electricity Data Import:
  - The notebook imports the electricity dataset and confirms that the data is in the correct format for further processing.

Preprocessing Steps:

The preprocessing workflow includes:

  - Cleaning the data and handling missing values.
  - Converting and formatting date/time information.
  - Extracting relevant features for forecasting.

Regression Model Setup:
  - The notebook defines a regression model architecture suitable for predicting electricity consumption. The chosen model is trained on the preprocessed data.

Training and Performance Evaluation:
  - After training, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated through numerical metrics, helping to quantify its forecasting accuracy.
